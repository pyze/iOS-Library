This is the [Pyze&reg;](http://pyze.com) iOS framework github page.  

**Pyze is a Growth Intelligence&reg; platform for mobile app publishers**. Signup at Pyze, install and initialize the Pyze SDK and watch your app grow.

Pyze recommends installing the **CocoaPods** version instead of the Pyze.framework listed on this page. 

Visit the wiki page below to learn more about: 
* **installing** either the *CocoaPods* version or the *framework* version of the Pyze SDK, 
* **initializing** it in your *Objective-C* or *Swift app*, and 
* optionally using **events** in your *Objective-C* or *Swift* app
