This is the [Pyze&reg;](http://pyze.com) iOS framework github page.  

Pyze is a Growth Intelligence&reg; platform for mobile app publishers. Signup at Pyze, install and initilize the Pyze SDK and watch your app grow.

Pyze recommends installing the cocopods version instead of the Pyze.framework listed on this page. Visit the wiki page below to learn more about installing the SDK (either the cocopods version or the framework) and integrating it in your app.  Both the Cocopods version and Framework version support iOS 7.x, 8.x and 9.x.
