This is the [Pyze&reg;](http://pyze.com) framework github page.  We highly recommend installing the cocopods version instead of Pyze.framework. Visit the wiki page to learn more about installation and integration of either the cocopods version or the framework version.  Both versions support iOS 7.x, 8.x and 9.x.
