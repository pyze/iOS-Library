This is the [Pyze&reg;](http://pyze.com) framework github page.  Pyze is a Growth Intelligence&reg; platform for mobile app publishers. 

We highly recommend installing the cocopods version instead of Pyze.framework. Visit the wiki page to learn more about installation and integration of either the cocopods version or the framework version.  Both the Cocopods version and Framework version support iOS 7.x, 8.x and 9.x.
