**Pyze is a Growth Intelligence&reg; platform for mobile app publishers**. Signup at Pyze, install and initialize the Pyze SDK and watch your app grow.

Pyze recommends installing the **cocopods** version instead of the Pyze.framework listed on this page. 

Visit the wiki page below to learn more about: 
* **installing** either the cocopods version or the framework version of the Pyze SDK, 
* **initializing** it in your Objective-C or Swift app, and 
* optionally **using events** in your Objective-C or Swift app

iOS versions supported are 7.x, 8.x and 9.x.
